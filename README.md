# Student Placement Prediction Model

## Overview

This project implements a predictive model to determine a student's placement likelihood based on their Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) and Intelligence Quotient (IQ). The model leverages machine learning techniques to provide insights into potential placement outcomes for students.

## Features

- **Predictive Modeling**: The heart of the project lies in the predictive model that analyzes the input data, consisting of CGPA and IQ, to forecast a student's placement status.
  
- **Scalability**: The implementation is designed to handle datasets of varying sizes, ensuring scalability and adaptability to different educational institutions.

- **Data Visualization**: Explore the interactive data visualizations included in this project to gain a deeper understanding of how CGPA and IQ contribute to placement predictions.

## Getting Started

### Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine and install the required dependencies using the provided requirements.txt file.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/end-to-end-toy-project.git
cd end-to-end-toy-project
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```
## Prediction

Once the model is trained, you can use it to make predictions for new data points.

```bash python predict.py --cgpa 8.5 --iq 120 ```
